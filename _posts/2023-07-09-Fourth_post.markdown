During the course of this week, significant progress has been made in completing the copy section pertaining to the labels section. The systematic approach I have undertaken involves a series of steps. Primarily, within the metadata section, one encounters multiple files, such as colorlabel, picklabel, and rating, all of which necessitate seamless integration with the Digikam application manager, the platform housing the image album.

The crucial role of both the context menu helper and import context menu becomes evident in this context. Specifically, leveraging the capabilities of the context menu helper, I have incorporated an additional option, which essentially enables the copying of the label section within the void label function. Subsequently, the metadata associated with picklabel, colorlabel, and rating is meticulously extracted, drawing upon the functionalities offered by the context menu. The extracted information is then duly stored for subsequent actions.
