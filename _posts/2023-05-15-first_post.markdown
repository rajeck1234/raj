## About Me -

I am Utkarsh Kumar, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Industries Management from the esteemed IIT Kharagpur. I am currently in my third year of study. I am pleased to announce that I have been selected for the prestigious Google Summer of Code program this year. During the program, my focus will be on enhancing the properties management of Digikam.

## Digikam Poperties Managment
Currently, users are endeavoring to modify images with a single click, such as altering image tags, author names, and the body text associated with the images. Consequently, I am actively engaged in devising a solution to address this issue. Primarily, my workflow revolves around the properties management of Digikam.</p>
    
## What it's all about

The majority of the images contain Exif data. In order to handle these images, it is necessary to extract all the metadata and store them in CSV files. To achieve this, a Python script is utilized to efficiently store a substantial amount of image metadata. Following this step, a command is executed to enable batch editing of the metadata, allowing for simultaneous modification of multiple images' metadata.

Digikam is an exceptional application that offers a multitude of advanced features, particularly in the realm of image editing. At present, my primary focus lies in exploring avenues to further enhance its capabilities, aiming to elevate the application to new levels of excellence.</p>
