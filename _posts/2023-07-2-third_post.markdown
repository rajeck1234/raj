During the course of this week , my primary objective is to incorporate the functionality of copying and pasting tags within the context of the Digikam application software.
In order to achieve this, I have been working within the Digikam context helper menu, ensuring the availability of all the necessary data. The focal point of my efforts lies
in the modification of this particular section by introducing a copy feature, which will enable users to duplicate and subsequently paste metadata tags according to their respective
labels.

The fundamental purpose behind this endeavor is to furnish Digikam users with a copy-and-paste option, thereby affording them the capability to effortlessly replicate metadata tags.
A significant portion of the work pertaining to this objective has already been completed, and my subsequent aim is to seamlessly continue this endeavor, thereby further enhancing its
implementation. In order to achieve optimal results, I seek the guidance of experienced mentors who can provide valuable insights on how to improve and refine this feature.

As per the prescribed instructions, I intend to incorporate a copy menu and a paste menu, specifically designed to handle the duplication and subsequent transfer of metadata.
Additionally, I have dedicated considerable time in the past two weeks to familiarize myself with the fundamental aspects of Digikam, enabling me to leverage its properties effectively.
I am particularly interested in exploring possibilities for enhancing its functionality by incorporating new menu options.

To facilitate the realization of this goal, I have submitted a merge request to initiate the implementation process.
It is my firm belief that this comprehensive approach will enable the seamless integration of the desired features, with a specific focus on metadata information related to various elements,
such as tags, ratings, color labels, pick labels, titles, comments, and GPS information. Consequently, the selected metadata will be successfully copied from the source ItemInfo and propagated
to all designated target ItemInfo entities.
# IMPLEMENT DETAILS
In the app section, it is imperative to integrate a ContextMenuHelper file section, which assumes the role of a centralized repository for housing all the properties pertaining to the app. These properties encompass a wide range of actions, including the addition of tags and the provision of comprehensive details regarding the tags. The primary objective of this section is to achieve the following:

1. Introduce a copy functionality that empowers users to replicate both the name and corresponding value of a tag, subsequently allowing them to paste the copied tag. It is important to note that this particular capability should be applicable to all file sections that are associated with the given tag.

2. Effectuate the implementation of addActionNewTag file section, a function that follows a predefined pathway, outlining the essential steps required to accomplish the desired functionality. Instead of simply adding a new tag the path same use for the paste, this particular functionality is primarily focused on offering users the option to paste the previously copied tag. By copying the pertinent data and generating a paste option, the system stands poised for execution through the employment of a boolean function.

3. Augment the contextmenuhelper_tag by incorporating all the essential functions that are directly associated with tags. This enhancement necessitates the modification of existing functions to include the copy and paste options, thus empowering users with comprehensive control over the management and manipulation of tags within the app section.

Now i am doing work on the future like colorlabel,rating,Picklabel and GPS Location

# Write Now focusing on colorlabel

In the ColorLabelWidget section of the file, the specific objective is to incorporate a copy action for the color labels and subsequently include them in the tag's copy information. Moreover, these copied color labels should also be made available as options for pasting.

The primary focus of all the associated functions is to modify and copy the information present in the label section within the metadata label section. This can be achieved by implementing the copy function within the ContextMenuHelper. The responsibility of this function is to copy the relevant information, and subsequently, provide an option for pasting the copied data. And next procedure pick label after that rating
