During the course of this week, my primary objective is to incorporate the functionality of copying and pasting tags within the context of the Digikam application software.
In order to achieve this, I have been working within the Digikam context helper menu, ensuring the availability of all the necessary data. The focal point of my efforts lies
in the modification of this particular section by introducing a copy feature, which will enable users to duplicate and subsequently paste metadata tags according to their respective
labels.

The fundamental purpose behind this endeavor is to furnish Digikam users with a copy-and-paste option, thereby affording them the capability to effortlessly replicate metadata tags.
A significant portion of the work pertaining to this objective has already been completed, and my subsequent aim is to seamlessly continue this endeavor, thereby further enhancing its
implementation. In order to achieve optimal results, I seek the guidance of experienced mentors who can provide valuable insights on how to improve and refine this feature.

As per the prescribed instructions, I intend to incorporate a copy menu and a paste menu, specifically designed to handle the duplication and subsequent transfer of metadata.
Additionally, I have dedicated considerable time in the past two weeks to familiarize myself with the fundamental aspects of Digikam, enabling me to leverage its properties effectively.
I am particularly interested in exploring possibilities for enhancing its functionality by incorporating new menu options.

To facilitate the realization of this goal, I have submitted a merge request to initiate the implementation process.
It is my firm belief that this comprehensive approach will enable the seamless integration of the desired features, with a specific focus on metadata information related to various elements,
such as tags, ratings, color labels, pick labels, titles, comments, and GPS information. Consequently, the selected metadata will be successfully copied from the source ItemInfo and propagated
to all designated target ItemInfo entities.
